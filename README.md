This is a gallery of [Voilà](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila)
examples. Use this for inspiration on using Voilà and
[ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets).

View the gallery at [https://voila-gallery.github.io](https://voila-gallery.github.io)

## Contributing new examples

1. Create a repository with your notebook. You can start from the [hello-world](https://github.com/voila-gallery/hello-world-example) example.
2. [Test the repository on Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#preparing-a-repository-for-binder). The gallery launches the examples on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org).
3. Create a PR to [voila-gallery.org](https://github.com/voila-gallery/voila-gallery.github.io) that
   modifies `_data/gallery.yaml`.
   You will need to fill in the following fields:
   - `title`: the title used in the page thumbnail.
   - `description`: the description used in the page thumbnail.
   - `url`: the URL of the notebook to render.
   - `repo_url`: the URL of the repository serving as source.
   - `ref`: the commit hash used to pin to a specific version of the example
   - `image_url`: the URL of the picture to use as thumbnail.
4. Once the PR is merged into `master`, the gallery is automatically redeployed and the new example will be visible shortly after.
